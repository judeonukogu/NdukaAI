# NdukaAI: AI-Powered Digital Apprenticeship Platform

## Project Overview
NdukaAI is a conceptual framework and prototype for a digital platform that modernizes the Igbo Apprenticeship System (IAS) using Artificial Intelligence. It aims to connect mentors and apprentices globally for skills development, cultural exchange, and entrepreneurship, culminating in the creation of sustainable digital startups.

## The Problem
Traditional apprenticeship models face challenges in scalability, accessibility, and adaptation to the digital economy. Existing digital solutions lack cultural integration and structured pathways to business ownership.

## The Solution
NdukaAI leverages AI to:
- Onboard and create User profiles from their prompts 
- Intelligently match mentors and mentees based on skills, goals, and cultural compatibility.
- Provide a structured 6-month program for digital skills and entrepreneurship which culminates to a digital startup creation
- Integrate a digital startup marketplace to connect graduating apprentices with investors for seed funding.
- Preserve the core values of the Igbo Apprenticeship System in a digital context.
- Provide personalized mentorship

## Repository Contents
- /designs : High-fidelity screens and prototypes created in Visily.ai.
- /docs : Research paper, literature review, and project documentation.
- survey.pdf : Feasibility validation survey for mentors and mentees.

## Key Features (Visualized)

## Research & Validation
This project is backed by extensive research into apprenticeship models, AI algorithms, and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The conceptual framework is designed to address SDG 1 (No Poverty), 4 (Quality Education), 8 (Decent Work), and 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure).


## Future Roadmap
1.  Development of a functional MVP.
2.  Pilot testing and user feedback collection.
3.  Partnership development with educational institutions and NGOs.
